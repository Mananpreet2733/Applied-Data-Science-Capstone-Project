# Applied-Data-Science-Capstone-Project
In this capstone, we'll predict the success of the Falcon 9 first stage landing. SpaceX's $62 million launch cost, significantly lower than competitors' $165 million, is due to reusing the first stage. Accurate predictions can help determine launch costs and aid alternate companies in bidding against SpaceX.
